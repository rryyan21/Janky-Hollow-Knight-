# Janky-Hollow-Knight

For the final project in my ICS4U1 course, I was given a template of a basic and somewhat unfinished Zelda-like game, and my task was to build something entirely new from that foundation. The project was unique in that it focused on teaching us how to work within an unfamiliar development environment—Greenfoot, an IDE we had never used before. Greenfoot is designed for creating games and simulations, and its unique features required me to quickly familiarize myself with its structure and documentation.

This project wasn’t just about coding; it was about learning how to effectively work with new tools and resources. I had to navigate unfamiliar documentation, adapt to new programming syntax, and figure out how to integrate various game mechanics into the template. It was both a technical and creative challenge, allowing me to stretch my skills in problem-solving, logic, and game design.

One of the most valuable aspects of this project was the creative freedom it offered. While the template provided a basic starting point, it was up to me to decide what features to implement, how to improve the user interface, and how to make the game more engaging. This process allowed me to experiment with different programming techniques and design ideas, and I gained a deeper understanding of how to balance creativity with functionality in software development.

Ultimately, the project was an excellent opportunity to hone my programming skills while learning how to adapt to a new language and environment. It reinforced the importance of being adaptable, exploring new tools, and working independently to overcome obstacles—all while enjoying the freedom to create something truly my own.
